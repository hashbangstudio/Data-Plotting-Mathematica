Data-Plotting-Mathematica
=========================

Various examples of how to plot data in Mathematica.

Mathematica should already be installed on Raspbian but if not:

`sudo apt-get install wolfram-engine`


To run the scripts from the command line:

`wolfram -script example.wl`

To run in a window, open mathematica and open the example up in a notebook.

NOTE : the windowed/GUI version of mathematica can be very slow on the Raspberry Pi, so it is often best to use the command line version
